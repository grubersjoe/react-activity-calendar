## Installation

```shell
npm install react-activity-calendar
```

## Features

- any number of activity levels üìà
- color themes üåà
- dark & light mode ‚ú®
- tooltips ü™ß
- event handlers ‚ÅâÔ∏è
- localization üåç

The component expects activity data in the following shape, where each activity level must be in the
given level bounds. Per default the bounds are `[0, 4]` (see
[documentation](https://grubersjoe.github.io/react-activity-calendar/?path=/story/react-activity-calendar--activity-levels)).
It is up to you how to generate and classify your data.

```tsx
import { ActivityCalendar } from 'react-activity-calendar'

const data = [
  {
    date: '2024-06-23',
    count: 2,
    level: 1,
  },
  {
    date: '2024-08-02',
    count: 16,
    level: 4,
  },
  {
    date: '2024-11-29',
    count: 11,
    level: 3,
  },
]

function Calendar() {
  return <ActivityCalendar data={data} />
}
```

## FAQ

### Why does the calendar not render in environment x?

If you encounter issues rendering this component in a specific React framework, please refer to the
following repository. It contains working examples for Astro, Next.js, Remix and Vite. Server side
rendering (SSR) is supported.

[Framework examples](https://github.com/grubersjoe/react-activity-calendar-tests)

### Why is Create React App unsupported?

Create React App (CRA) is considered
[abandoned](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/discussions/11086), and you probably should
not use it anymore (more
[background](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/11180#issuecomment-874748552)).
Using this component inside CRA will lead to errors for reasons described in issue
[#105](https://github.com/grubersjoe/react-activity-calendar/issues/105). This repo is not for CRA
support questions. If you encounter issues, you need to fix those yourself given the maintenance
state of CRA. Personally, I would recommend using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) instead of CRA.

### Why is the tooltip library x unsupported?

It seems impossible to support all kinds of tooltip libraries since they are all implemented
differently. See this [issue](https://github.com/grubersjoe/react-activity-calendar/issues/32) and
especially this
[comment](https://github.com/grubersjoe/react-activity-calendar/issues/32#issuecomment-1735208729).
The next major version will be based on a headless approach for tooltips, so that styling is
completely up to the user.
